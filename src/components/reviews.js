      <p className="wedding-section-heading">Located in the heart of Pioneer Square in Seattle Washington, THE 101 is an industrial-chic, blank-canvas venue full of possibilities.

THE 101 features a unique combination of red and white brick walls, ample natural light and expansive ceilings, creating a stunning ambiance that needs very little, if any, decor. However, we’ve seen clients take this flexibility and create some of the most stunning events. You can set up seating for your ceremony in front of the generous windows, bathing the room in natural light. You can exchange your vows against a backdrop of the gorgeous street view. Following this, the room can be flipped to accommodate a reception of up to 200 guests seated banquet-style and many more for a cocktail-style reception.

THE 101 welcomes you to choose your own vendors and can provide you with a list of recommended partners. THE 101 offers 24 hour rentals so that you can have the venue from 10am on the day of your event to 10am the following day, allowing you plenty of time to set-up and party. Couples can also choose from a range of decor and services to elevate their celebration – from a photo booth, draping, a ceremony arch and more.

Included with the space rental are tables and chairs for 200 of your favorite people, cocktail tables, a statement making bar. And THE 101 is pet-friendly so your favorite fur friend can be part of the celebration as well.

The team at THE 101 understands how much work goes into a wedding and will strive to create a seamless experience in the lead-up to your big day. You will be provided with a concierge to answer all of your questions about the venue. THE 101 also offers a range of planning packages, from month-of coordination to full service, to help ease the planning process.</p>
